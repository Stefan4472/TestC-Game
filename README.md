# TestC-Game
Top-down 2D adventure game written in C++

Read about it [on my blog](https://www.stefanonsoftware.com/post/project-overview-c%2B%2B-game).

*Note (October 2020): I worked on this project a long time ago, before I had learned best practices for C++ and C++11. Because of this, it is not organized very well. Furthermore, the project got a little too complicated and I got a little too busy, so I stopped working on it. I am currently working on a rewrite of this game, but the code is private for the moment.*
