A top-down 2D adventure game written in C++. I started this project because I wanted to learn C++ and because everyone talks about how fast C++ is (yes, it is very fast). The scope of the project grew immensely and I left it unfinished back in 2018 to work on other projects. In 2020 I revisited the project, and was surprised to realize it was a hopeless mess--my coding skills had really improved since then, and I decided to just give it another try from scratch rather than trying to fix this project. The new project is [here](https://github.com/Stefan4472/Cpp-Adventure-2).


This article [on my blog](https://www.stefanonsoftware.com/post/project-overview-c%2B%2B-game) explains my goals for this game and shows some video clips from it. I don't have instructions on how to compile the project, but they can be reverse-engineered from the (probably-not-functional) [Makefile](https://github.com/Stefan4472/TestC-Game/blob/master/src/Makefile).
